1. No global. The inode is passed by reference.

I noticed that the function doesn't set

           inode->flags = 0;

That line needs to be added to make sure that the inode
 passed-by-reference is initialized correctly. 

You have to create an inode and then initialize it and
then store it to your disk. That is done in format(). There is
 no need to use malloc(). You just have to create a static structure
 and initialize it properly.

2. No. No need to malloc(). What would you malloc()? That is only needed
 to allocate memory dynamically.

3. 100 KB, not 100MB. The disk, when formatted, is constant in size. It's not
 a variable-sized virtual disk as you may know from VMWare or VirtualBox.

4. In filesystem.c, the only thing that is implemented is intToByteArray() and
 byteArrayToInt(). Everything else needs to be implemented.

    Copy the main function from filesystem.c into main.c and use it to
 implement your test code.
